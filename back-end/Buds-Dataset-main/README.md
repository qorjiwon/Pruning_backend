Grapevine pruning is conducted during winter and it is a very important and expensive task for the wine producers in order to manage their vineyard. In grapevine pruning every year the past year canes should be removed and give place to the new arrival canes to grow and produce grapes. It is a difficult procedure and it is not yet fully automated, except of some attempts that have been made by the research community. Based on the literature grapevine pruning automation is approximated with the usage of computer vision and image processing methods except some implementations that use robotic arms in order to achieve cane pruning. Despite the attempts that have been made to automate grapevine pruning it remains a hard task for the above mentioned domains for the reason that has several challenges like cane overlapping, complex backgrounds etc. In this paper an image dataset is proposed for grapevine plants skeleton segmentation for the purpose of grapevine pruning. Based on this dataset a computer vision solution could be implemented for grapevine skeleton segmentation and pruning with a robot sup-port.
